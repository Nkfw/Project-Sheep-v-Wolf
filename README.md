My second, finished at some point, prototype in Unity. I used Claude Code more wisely now, since it was doing code review with the initial setting of what architecture I wanted to see, plus I required it to comment my code, heavily document most of my steps to ensure that
I won't forget anything and Claude won't do anything stupide if I ask it for significant code changes. This new approach saved me a lot of time (basically, almost all the bugs were 'mine', so it was much easier to fix), plus I got the sense of what working with a code
agent should look like, when you must control the code base. 

This time, I also used some free assets from Unity store, but decided to draw my own + requested Gemini to draw the colored versions of my scetches. Since drawning in photoshop of GIMP wasn't the goal of this prototype, I decided that it's fine to do my scatches with a pencil 
and request the Gemini to 'transform' them into PNGs.
